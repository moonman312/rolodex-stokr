# rolodex-stokr
I'm one of the worst people at keeping up with others as much as I wish I would. 

I want to build some kind of super simple personal tool or something super simple that has a list of people I want to stay in touch with and then I can set how often I want to stay in touch with each of them and then it reminds me everyday with the list of people in order of how overdue it is until I confirm I have interacted with them and their timer is restarted.

This is a personal project for my own utility, but if you have the same struggle, feel free to clone it


## Set Up
crontab -e
to run the script at 9am every morning:
```0 9 * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/your/script.py```
