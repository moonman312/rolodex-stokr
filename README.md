# rolodex-stokr
I'm one of the worst people at keeping up with others as much as I wish I would. 

I want to build some kind of super simple personal tool or something super simple that has a list of people I want to stay in touch with and then I can set how often I want to stay in touch with each of them and then it reminds me everyday with the list of people in order of how overdue it is until I confirm I have interacted with them and their timer is restarted.

This is a personal project for my own utility, but if you have the same struggle, feel free to clone it

- **An Email Account** (Gmail recommended for SMTP)
- **Optional**: Twilio Account for SMS reminders

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ~~~bash
   git clone https://github.com/moonman312/rolodex-stokr.git
   cd rolodex-stokr
   ~~~

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**

    ~~~bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ~~~

3. **Install Dependencies**

    ~~~bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ~~~

### Configuration

1. **Create `config.py`**

   In the project root directory, create a file named `config.py` and add the following configuration variables:

   ~~~python
   # config.py

   # Email credentials
   sender_email_address = 'your_email@example.com'     # Replace with your email
   app_password = 'your_email_app_password'            # Replace with your email app password

   # Twilio credentials (Optional)
   TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID = 'your_twilio_account_sid'      # Replace with your Twilio Account SID
   TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN = 'your_twilio_auth_token'        # Replace with your Twilio Auth Token
   TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER = 'your_twilio_phone_number'    # Replace with your Twilio Phone Number
   ~~~

   **Note**: For Gmail users, you might need to enable [App Passwords](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833) if you have 2-Step Verification enabled.
